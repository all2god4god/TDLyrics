# Yep still working on it.

Just need to find a good program that doesn't make me mad to add images into the documents


# Startup window
This is the most important window for everything you will be doing in TDLyrics(besides reprogramming for your own needs)

![TDLyrics Main Window](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63216908/127269207-ddf94fe9-becd-4ecf-81e1-f7600f9233f0.png)

This is the main window in TDLyrics. This will great you from the start(as long as I didn't forget to check "start in perform mode")

## The basics you need to know -

### Main Window

![Main Window Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63216908/127270737-a9a73a05-7daf-41ab-8928-be8c0df18c87.png)


This is the Main window of the program. All of the GUI controls are ran through here and every feature inside TDLyrics is avaliable here. Right now this is better as a diagnostics tool then it is as a functional program, it tells you the correct positions of everything in the rest of the program for use with MIDI or OSC and gives an overview of most of your inputs and outputs.

For more information on using this window look further down this readme and it will show you the basic usuage of this window.

### Preview

![Preview Window Preview](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63216908/127270968-59435874-7360-4e70-bdba-f7869a4c6dcd.png)

This Preview window is for use with Ableton Live, or another program running MIDI.

This shows you everything that is going on in the program and each of the "feeds" (Or sources - This is to be sent to NDI, display outputs, windows.. but is not specifically being output)

### Confidence Monitor

This automatically fills your whole screen with a confidence monitor.

Right now there is two confidence feeds built in. You can use them how fits for you - but each can be customized for what you need to see. 

Induding -

Battery information
Song title
Section title
Lyrics
Time
....

This switch by default shows confidene feed 2

Feed 1 and 2 can both show different information in different locations allowing you to keep a feed for youself to know what is going on at a glance in production - but on stage talent only sees what they need to.


### Index

This selects what is controlling the program. 

Below is the list of inputs. Selecting the number (from top to bottom) of the input it will put control of the program on that interface.

Right now it is -

Midi - 0
GUI - 1
OSC - 2

You can add your own input method and then switch to it from here without removing other input methods. 



# Basic turn on proceedure

# Settings
(Many are only avaliable through GUI, for much of the settings which are unneeded from Midi control)
