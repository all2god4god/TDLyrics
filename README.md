## ChordSmith http://www.statistics101.net/chordsmith/
This is used for converting Chord pro, chord over lyric or any lyrics to a format that TDLyrics can understand

It can be done manually(and I would suggest you do once or twice) but it will take 10 or 15 minutes per song compared to 3 or 4 minutes.
