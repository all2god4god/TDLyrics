# TD Lyrics - Touch designer lyric projection system

## The list of things this does(For google or the reader)
Midi control of lyrics from ableton live
OSC control of lyrics
Audio reactive backgrounds
Multi output
Confidence monitor(With chords, lyrics, and program status information)

# Setup

## Install Touchdesigner https://derivative.ca
Avaliable for free for personal use upto 720p

The paid versions start at about $600 but they have no limit on resultion and could be used to drive any screen your computer will handle.

## ChordSmith http://www.statistics101.net/chordsmith/
This is used for converting Chord pro, chord over lyric or any lyrics to a format that TDLyrics can understand

It can be done manually(and I would suggest you do once or twice) but it will take 10 or 15 minutes per song compared to 3 or 4 minutes. 

## NDI - https://www.ndi.tv
This is a simple protocal for video over IP.

It is not needed but it will allow you to send audio into touchdesigner from a digital audio workstation by adding a VST to a channel

NDI works over the network and on the same computer for viewering outputs of the program(For example to monitor the output without the GUI locally, or to send over the network to another computer or hardware decorder hooked into your projector)
